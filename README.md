# HABILITAS (PROTOTYPE)
Habilitas is a **tool to help people who lost their jobs during the COVID pandemy** who are now facing challenges to find a new one. We aim to provide a high quality platform where they can take use technology in their favour to expand their opportunities and leverage their capabilities as a professional. 

This is the prototype for the solution we developed for the CORONATHON hackathon which was promoted by ENAP and had Microsoft as a partner.
(https://coronathon.enap.gov.br/)

It is a **responsive website** to make it easier to access from all types of devices and screen sizes, and it was created using React.

## The App

Habilitas consists in a platform that connects people looking for jobs and the current opportunities in a diversity of companies. It is based on a system that already exists (SINE) but with some improvements regarding, specially, the standardisation of the data sent by both companies and job-seekers, and the creation of a page with a personalized dashboard showing the current skills the job-seeker possesses and the skills he/she should focus on developing for the job they are looking for. In the platform, it will also be possible to get suggestions of courses and trainings in order to develop the skills the professional is lacking and get in contact with a mentor that will help him/her through the journey of finding a job. Finally, it will also be possible to filter all the job postings in a manner that fits the profile of who is looking for the job.

#### Step-by-step

- HOME :house: (contains two links, one for the companies to create a job post, which at this moment is just a redirect to the current existing SINE website, and another for the job-seekers to register their profiles)
- REGISTER A PROFILE :heavy_plus_sign: (register form for people seeking a job, currently with only the main topics of what it will contain)
- LOGIN :arrow_right: (login screen for the job-seekers already registered in this platform. Mind that as it is only a prototype there is no authentication yet, so any value input in the fields is going to get accepted and will allow you to get to the internal pages -> when you click ENTRAR, you will get redirected to the dashboard)
- DASHBOARD :bar_chart: (personalized dashboard based on the job-seeker's profile assessment in terms of area/sector/opportunity intended and his/her main skills and competencies. It will also contain infos related to the main qualifications needed for the person to adjust to the market and a link to another page where he/she will find suggestions of courses and trainings designed specially based on his/her profile.)
- SUGGESTION OF COURSES :books: (page that contains suggestion of important courses and trainings for the person's professional development, aiming to adjust ou help this professional to become relevant to the labor market. It will show a vast diversity of themes but all in accordance to the person's profile)
- ABOUT US :memo: (infos about the Habilitas company)
- CONTACT :email: (page to get in contact with Habilitas)
